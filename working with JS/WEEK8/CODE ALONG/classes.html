<!-- # Day 7: Classes and Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand why classes make code more organized and reusable
- Create classes with properties and methods
- Use constructors to initialize objects consistently
- Apply inheritance to share code between related classes
- Build a complete class-based system for your café project

## Why We Need Classes

When building your café project, you might start by creating objects directly for each menu item.  
For example, you may write code for a `coffee` object, a `sandwich` object, and a `cake` object.  
But very quickly, you’ll notice problems:

- **Lots of repetition** → Each object repeats the same methods (like `getDisplayInfo`, `updatePrice`).  
- **Error-prone** → If you update one object’s method, you have to manually update all the others.  
- **Inconsistent structure** → One item may have a property that another doesn’t, which causes bugs.  
- **Hard to maintain** → As the menu grows, it becomes messy and unmanageable.  

This is where **Classes** come in.  

### What Are Classes?

A **Class** is like a **blueprint** for creating objects.  
Instead of writing the same code for every object, you define a **template** once, and then create multiple objects (instances) from it.  

Think of it like:
- A house blueprint (class) can be reused to build many houses (objects).  
- Each house can have its own color, furniture, and style, but they all follow the same structure.  

### Benefits of Using Classes
- **Consistency** → Every object created from a class has the same properties and methods.  
- **Reusability** → Define once, use many times.  
- **Maintainability** → If you update the class, all future objects automatically benefit.  
- **Professional structure** → This is the way real-world applications are built.

## Key Concepts You’ll Learn
1. **Class declaration** – how to define a class.  
2. **Constructor** – a special method that runs when you create an object.  
3. **Methods** – functions that belong to a class.  
4. **The `this` keyword** – refers to the current object being used.  
5. **Inheritance** – how one class can extend another and reuse its functionality.   

With these, you’ll be able to transform your café project into a **well-structured, object-oriented system**. -->

## The Problem Classes Solve

### Why We Need Classes -->

<!-- From your café project, you might have written code like this:
// Creating menu items the hard way - lots of repetition
let coffee = {
    id: 1,
    name: "Coffee",
    price: 3.50,
    category: "Drinks",
    getDisplayInfo: function() {
        return `${this.name} - $${this.price}`;
    },
    updatePrice: function(newPrice) {
        this.price = newPrice;
    }
};

let sandwich = {
    id: 2,
    name: "Sandwich", 
    price: 8.00,
    category: "Food",
    getDisplayInfo: function() {
        return `${this.name} - $${this.price}`;  // Same code repeated!
    },
    updatePrice: function(newPrice) {           // Same code repeated!
        this.price = newPrice;
    }
}; -->

<!-- // And you'd repeat this for every menu item...


**Problems with this approach:**
- Lots of repeated code
- Easy to make mistakes
- Hard to maintain (if you change one method, you have to change it everywhere)
- No guarantee all items have the same structure

**Classes solve this by providing a template for creating similar objects.** -->
